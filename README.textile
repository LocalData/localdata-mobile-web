h1. "LocalData":http://localdata.com

We want to make it very easy for cities, nonprofits, neighborhood organizations and others to collect good information about the things they care about, like property condition, vacancy, points of interest, and more. You can read more at "localdata.com":http://localdata.com

This mobile data collection app is part of the greater LocalData toolkit.

h2. Running the app 

The app is static HTML pages + javascript. It does assume that it's being served by the same host as the "LocalData API":https://github.com/LocalData/localdata-api

h2. Building/deploying

We use Grunt to prepare the app for deployment. Run @grunt@ or @grunt build@ to build the minified, deployable package. You can configure locations in a @dev-settings.json@ file, after which @grunt deploy@ or @grunt deploy:mylocation@ will sync the built package to an S3 location. Deployment requires "s3cmd":http://s3tools.org/s3cmd

Sample @dev-settings.json@:

bc. {
  "deploy" : {
    "default" : "s3://mybucket/web/my-mobile-dev/",
    "dev" : "s3://mybucket/web/my-mobile-dev/",
    "production" : "s3://mybucket/production-web/mobile"
  }
}
